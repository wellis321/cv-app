        'answer' => 'After logging in, navigate to the "Job Applications" section in your dashboard.

By default, you\'ll get reminders 7 days, 3 days, and 1 day before closing dates, but you can customize these in your Profile settings—choose from preset options (14, 7, 3, or 1 day) or add your own custom days.

    // AI CV Features FAQs
    [
        'question' => 'What are AI CV features?',
        'answer' => 'AI CV features use artificial intelligence to help you create better CVs. You can generate job-specific CV variants automatically by pasting a job description, and get AI-powered quality assessments with scores and improvement suggestions. These features help you tailor your CV to each job application and identify areas for improvement.'
    ],
    [
        'question' => 'How does AI CV rewriting work?',
        'answer' => 'AI CV rewriting analyzes a job description and your current CV, then automatically rewrites relevant sections (like your professional summary, work experience descriptions, and skills) to better match the job requirements. The AI emphasizes relevant keywords, highlights matching experiences, and maintains factual accuracy. You can review and edit the AI-generated content before saving it as a new CV variant.'
    ],
    [
        'question' => 'What is a CV variant?',
        'answer' => 'A CV variant is a customised version of your CV tailored for a specific job application. You can create multiple variants - one for each job you\'re applying to. Your master CV remains unchanged, and each variant can be edited independently. When you generate a variant from a job (using "Generate AI CV for this job" or by selecting that job in the create form), the variant is linked to that job so you can see which CV was used for which application. In the CV Variants list, linked variants show a "Linked" badge next to the job title.'
    ],
    [
        'question' => 'How does CV quality assessment work?',
        'answer' => 'CV quality assessment uses browser-based AI to analyse your CV and provide scores for overall quality, ATS compatibility, content quality, formatting, and keyword matching (when a job description is provided). The AI runs directly in your browser - no cloud services needed. You\'ll receive specific strengths, weaknesses, and actionable recommendations to improve your CV. You can assess any CV variant or your master CV at any time. Organisations or users with cloud AI accounts can also use cloud-based AI if configured.'
    ],
    [
        'question' => 'Is AI CV rewriting accurate?',
        'answer' => 'The AI maintains factual accuracy - it doesn\'t invent experiences, dates, or qualifications. However, it may need refinement to match your personal writing style. Always review AI-generated content before using it. The AI focuses on rewording and emphasizing relevant information rather than creating new content. All AI features run in your browser - no cloud services required. Cloud-based AI options are available for organisations or users who have configured them.'
    ],
    [
        'question' => 'Are AI CV features free?',
        'answer' => 'Yes! AI CV features are available to all users, including those on the free plan. All AI features run directly in your browser using browser-based AI - no cloud services, API keys, or setup required. You can generate unlimited CV variants and run quality assessments as often as you like. For organisations or users who prefer cloud-based AI (OpenAI, Anthropic, Gemini, etc.), those options are also available if configured.'
    ],
    [
        'question' => 'How do I generate an AI CV for a job application?',
        'answer' => 'The easiest way is from the job itself. In the content editor (Build My CV), open Manage Jobs, then open the job you want to tailor for. Click <strong>Generate AI CV for this job</strong> for a one-click tailored CV that stays in the editor, or <strong>Tailor CV for this job…</strong> to open the full form and choose which sections to tailor. You can also go to the standalone Job Applications page and click "Generate AI CV" on any job, or go to CV Variants and click "Create New CV with AI" and select a job from the dropdown.'
    ],
    [
        'question' => 'What is the difference between "Generate AI CV for this job" and "Tailor CV for this job"?',
        'answer' => '<strong>Generate AI CV for this job</strong> creates a new CV variant in one click using the job description and your master CV. The AI rewrites relevant sections automatically and you stay in the content editor to review the new variant. <strong>Tailor CV for this job…</strong> opens the full "Generate AI CV" form with that job already selected, so you can choose which sections to tailor, pick a different source CV, or adjust options before generating. Use the first for speed; use the second when you want more control.'
    ],
    [
        'question' => 'Can I edit AI-generated CV variants?',
        'answer' => 'Absolutely! AI-generated CV variants can be edited just like your master CV. You can modify any section, add or remove content, and customise it to your preferences. The AI provides a starting point, but you have full control over the final content.'
    ],
    [
        'question' => 'Can I upload files with my job applications?',
        'answer' => 'Yes! You can upload files (PDF, Word documents, Excel spreadsheets, text files, and images) directly to each job application. This is perfect for storing job descriptions, application materials, or any related documents. The AI can automatically read these files when generating CV variants, so you don\'t need to copy and paste job descriptions manually.'
    ],
    [
        'question' => 'How does file upload work with AI CV generation?',
        'answer' => 'When you upload a job description file (like a PDF or Word document) to a job application, the AI can automatically extract and read the content when generating your CV variant. This means you can simply upload the job posting file and click "Generate AI CV" - no need to copy and paste the job description. The AI will use the file content along with any text you\'ve entered in the job description field.'
    ],
    [
        'question' => 'What file types can I upload?',
        'answer' => 'You can upload PDF files, Word documents (.doc, .docx), Excel spreadsheets (.xls, .xlsx), plain text files (.txt), CSV files, and images (JPEG, PNG). Maximum file size is 10MB per file. You can upload multiple files per job application.'
    ],
    [
        'question' => 'Can I extract text from uploaded files?',
        'answer' => 'Yes! For uploaded files like PDFs, Word documents, and text files, you can click the "Extract Text" button to automatically populate the job description field. This is useful if you want to see or edit the extracted text before using it with AI features.'
    ],
    // Organisation FAQs
    [
        'question' => 'How do I get an organisation account?',
        'answer' => 'To create an organisation account, fill out the request form on our <a href="/organisations.php" class="text-blue-600 hover:text-blue-800 underline">For Organisations</a> page. You\'ll need to provide your organisation name, primary contact details, expected number of candidates and team members, organisation type, and any specific requirements.

    ],
    [
        'question' => 'What types of organisations can use Simple CV Builder?',

If you manage candidates and need a centralised platform for CV management, we can help.'
    ],
    [
        'question' => 'How do I invite candidates to create their CV?',
        'answer' => 'As an organisation admin or recruiter, you can invite candidates by navigating to the "Candidates" section in your dashboard and clicking "Invite Candidate". Enter the candidate\'s email address, optionally add a personal message, and send the invitation. The candidate will receive an email with a link to create their account and start building their CV. Once they\'ve created their CV, you can view it directly from your Candidates page.'
    ],
    [
        'question' => 'Can candidates see other candidates\' CVs?',
        'answer' => 'No. Candidates can only see and edit their own CV. Privacy and security are important to us, so each candidate\'s CV is private to them. Only your organisation\'s team members can view candidate CVs, and this access is based on their role permissions (Owner, Admin, Recruiter, or Viewer).'
    ],
    [
        'question' => 'What are the different team roles and what can they do?',
        'answer' => 'Organisations have four role levels: <strong>Owner</strong> has full access including organisation settings, billing, and team management; <strong>Admin</strong> can manage candidates, team members, and organisation settings (except billing); <strong>Recruiter</strong> can invite and manage their own candidates and view all candidates; <strong>Viewer</strong> has read-only access to view candidates and their CVs. Role permissions are clearly defined to ensure appropriate access control.'
    ],
    [
        'question' => 'How do I invite team members to my organisation?',
        'answer' => 'Owners and Admins can invite team members by going to the "Team" section in your dashboard and clicking "Invite Team Member". Enter their email address, select their role (Admin, Recruiter, or Viewer), optionally add a personal message, and send the invitation. The team member will receive an email invitation to join your organisation. Note: Only Owners can invite Admins, and you must not have reached your team member limit.'
    ],
    [
        'question' => 'What happens if I reach my candidate or team member limit?',
        'answer' => 'You\'ll see notifications when you\'re approaching your limits. If you need to increase your limits, you can request a limit increase from the Settings page. Simply select whether you need to increase candidate or team member limits, enter your requested new limit, optionally provide a reason, and submit your request. A super admin will review your request and approve or deny it. You\'ll be notified once a decision has been made.'
    ],
    [
        'question' => 'Can I customise my organisation\'s branding?',
        'answer' => 'Yes! Owners and Admins can customise your organisation\'s branding from the Settings page. You can upload your organisation logo (JPEG, PNG, GIF, or WebP, max 2MB), set your primary and secondary brand colours, and configure other organisation settings. These branding elements can appear in your candidates\' CVs when they use your organisation\'s templates.'
    ],
    [
        'question' => 'Can I change my organisation\'s name or settings?',
        'answer' => 'Yes! Owners and Admins can update organisation settings including the organisation name, URL slug, logo, branding colours, and candidate settings. You can also enable or disable candidate self-registration, set default CV visibility, and require approval for self-registered candidates. All of these can be managed from the Settings page.'
    ],
    [
        'question' => 'How do I transfer ownership of my organisation?',
        'answer' => 'Organisation owners can transfer ownership to another admin from the Settings page. This is an important action that gives the new owner full control over the organisation, including billing and settings. This action cannot be undone, so make sure you trust the new owner and that they\'re ready to take on this responsibility.'
    ],
    [
        'question' => 'What is candidate self-registration?',
        'answer' => 'Candidate self-registration allows candidates to register themselves using your organisation\'s registration link, rather than requiring you to invite them individually. You can enable or disable this feature in your organisation settings. If enabled, you can also choose to require approval for self-registered candidates before they can complete their CV, giving you control over who has access.'
    ],
    [
        'question' => 'How do I contact support for organisation-related issues?',
        'answer' => 'For organisation account setup, limit increase requests, or organisation-specific support, please email <a href="mailto:noreply@simple-job-tracker.com" class="text-blue-600 hover:text-blue-800 underline">noreply@simple-job-tracker.com</a>.
