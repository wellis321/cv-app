Whether it\'s a recruiter reaching out on LinkedIn, a networking contact mentioning an opening, or a surprise promotion opportunity, having a current CV means you won\'t miss out because you\'re scrambling to remember what you did three years ago.',

It\'s far easier to add accomplishments as they happen rather than trying to recall them months or years later. This ongoing documentation becomes particularly valuable during performance reviews or salary negotiations.',
