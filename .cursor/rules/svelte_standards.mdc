# Svelte and SvelteKit Development Standards

## Reference Documentation
- Always use the `svelte-complete-medium.txt` document as the primary reference for implementation patterns
- Prioritize modern Svelte 5 patterns over legacy approaches

## Reactivity
- Use Svelte 5 runes for state management:
  - `$state` for declaring reactive state
  - `$derived` for computed values
  - `$effect` for side effects and lifecycle
  - `$props` for component props
  - `$bindable` for two-way binding

## Routing & Files
- Follow SvelteKit's file-based routing conventions strictly
- Use proper file organization with `+page.svelte`, `+layout.svelte`, etc.
- Place reusable components in the lib directory
- Keep server-only code in `+page.server.js` or `$lib/server`

## Data Handling
- Use server-side load functions for data fetching
- Implement SvelteKit form actions for data mutations
- Leverage progressive enhancement for forms
- Stream data with promises when appropriate

## TypeScript
- Maintain proper type safety throughout
- Use TypeScript interfaces for component props
- Leverage `$types` for route parameter typing
- Follow the type patterns shown in the reference document

## Performance & Accessibility
- Apply SSR-friendly coding practices
- Avoid shared state on the server
- Keep load functions pure (no side effects)
- Implement proper semantic HTML and ARIA attributes
- Ensure keyboard navigation support

## Component Design
- Follow the component composition patterns from documentation
- Use Svelte's built-in transitions and animations
- Implement proper error handling with `+error.svelte`
- Use stores and context for cross-component state when needed

These standards ensure consistent implementation of Svelte and SvelteKit features,
maintainable code structure, and optimal performance throughout the CV application.
