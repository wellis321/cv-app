## Best Practices

1. **Keep master CV updated**: AI rewriting uses your master CV as the base
2. **Include complete job descriptions**: More detail = better AI rewriting
3. **Review AI output**: Always check AI-generated content for accuracy
4. **Use quality assessments**: Regularly assess your CV to identify improvements
5. **Create variants strategically**: Generate variants for jobs that are good matches
6. **Edit after generation**: Fine-tune AI-generated content to match your voice

## Limitations

- AI rewriting maintains factual accuracy but may need manual refinement
- Quality assessments are AI-generated suggestions, not guarantees
- Processing time depends on AI service (local Ollama may be slower)
- Requires internet connection for cloud AI services
- Local Ollama requires sufficient system resources

## Troubleshooting

**AI rewriting fails:**
- Check AI service configuration in `.env`
- Verify API keys are correct (for cloud services)
- Ensure Ollama is running (for local service)
- Check job description is not empty

**Quality assessment fails:**
- Ensure CV has sufficient content
- Check AI service is accessible
- Verify database connection

**Variant not displaying:**
- Check variant exists in database
- Verify user has access to variant
- Ensure CV data is properly loaded

## Future Enhancements

Planned improvements:
- Preview changes before saving AI-generated variants
- Accept/reject individual section changes
- Batch generate variants for multiple jobs
- Compare variants side-by-side
- Export assessment reports
- Integration with job matching services
