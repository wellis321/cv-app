# AI CV Features Documentation

## Overview

Simple CV Builder now includes powerful AI-powered features to help users create better CVs and improve their job application success rate. These features use artificial intelligence to rewrite CVs for specific job applications and provide quality assessments.

**AI Technology:** All AI features run directly in your browser using browser-based AI technology. No cloud services, API keys, or configuration required - it works immediately for all users. For organisations or users who prefer cloud-based AI (OpenAI, Anthropic, Gemini, etc.), those options are also available if configured in account settings.

## Features

### 1. AI CV Rewriting

Generate job-specific CV variants automatically by analyzing job descriptions and tailoring your CV content to match.

**How it works:**
- Paste a job description or select from your tracked job applications
- AI analyzes the job requirements and your current CV
- Automatically rewrites relevant sections (professional summary, work experience, skills)
- Creates a new CV variant linked to the job application
- You can review, edit, and customise the AI-generated content

**Access:**
- **From the job view (recommended):** In the content editor (Build My CV), open Manage Jobs, then open a job. Use **Generate AI CV for this job** for a one-click tailored CV (you stay in the editor), or **Tailor CV for this job…** to open the full form with that job pre-selected and choose which sections to tailor.
- From Job Applications page: Click "Generate AI CV" button on any job application
- From CV Variants page: Click "Generate AI CV" or "Create New CV with AI" button
- Direct URL: `/cv-variants/rewrite.php`

**Benefits:**
- Saves time by automatically tailoring your CV
- Improves keyword matching for ATS systems
- Maintains factual accuracy (doesn't invent experiences)
- Creates multiple versions for different job types

### 2. CV Quality Assessment

Get comprehensive AI-powered feedback on your CV with scores and actionable recommendations.

**What it assesses:**
- **Overall Quality** (0-100): General CV completeness and professionalism
- **ATS Compatibility** (0-100): How well your CV will pass Applicant Tracking Systems
- **Content Quality** (0-100): Relevance, impact, and specificity of content
- **Formatting** (0-100): Consistency, readability, and structure
- **Keyword Matching** (0-100): Alignment with job requirements (when job description provided)

**Feedback includes:**
- Strengths: What you're doing well
- Weaknesses: Areas that need improvement
- Recommendations: Specific, actionable steps to improve your CV

**Access:**
- From CV Variants page: Click "Assess" on any CV variant
- From Job Applications page: Click "Assess CV Quality" button
- Direct URL: `/cv-quality.php?variant_id=XXX`

### 3. CV Variants Management

Create and manage multiple versions of your CV for different job applications.

**Features:**
- **Master CV**: Your main CV that serves as the base for all variants
- **Job-Specific Variants**: Tailored CVs linked to specific job applications (shown with a "Linked" badge when linked)
- **AI-Generated Variants**: CVs created using AI rewriting
- **Custom Variants**: Manually created CV versions

**Recommended flow:** Complete your CV sections → add job applications → then generate a CV variant for each job. From a job view, use **Generate AI CV for this job** (one-click) or **Tailor CV for this job…** (opens form with job pre-selected) so you stay in the content editor.

**Management:**
- View all variants in one place (content editor: CV Variants panel, or standalone `/cv-variants.php`)
- Variants linked to jobs show job title and "Linked" badge; click the job to open it
- Rename variants for easy identification
- Delete variants you no longer need
- Edit any variant like a normal CV
- View variants in full CV format

**Access:**
- Content editor: Build My CV → CV Variants (or open a job → "Tailor CV for this job…")
- Direct URL: `/cv-variants.php`
- Linked from Job Applications page

     ```

### Database Schema

**CV Variants Table:**

### API Endpoints

**POST `/api/ai-rewrite-cv.php`**
- Generates job-specific CV variant
- Requires: `job_application_id` or `job_description`, `csrf_token`
- Optional: `cv_variant_id` (source CV, defaults to master)
- Returns: `variant_id` of newly created variant

**POST `/api/ai-assess-cv.php`**
- Assesses CV quality
- Requires: `csrf_token`
- Optional: `cv_variant_id`, `job_application_id`
- Returns: Assessment with scores and recommendations

## Generating from the Job View (Content Editor)

The smoothest way to create a job-specific CV is from the job itself, without leaving the content editor.

1. **Open the content editor** (Build My CV from your dashboard).
2. **Go to Manage Jobs** in the left-hand navigation and open the job you want to tailor for.
3. On the job view you will see:
   - **Generate AI CV for this job** — Creates a new tailored variant in one click. When done, you stay in the content editor and are taken to the CV Variants list so you can see the new variant.
   - **Tailor CV for this job…** — Opens the full "Generate AI CV" form with this job already selected. Use this when you want to choose which sections to tailor, pick a different source CV, or adjust options before generating.
4. If you use "Tailor CV for this job…", the job application dropdown and job description are pre-filled; you can then choose sections and submit.

Variants created from a job are **linked** to that job. In the CV Variants list, linked variants show a green "Linked" badge and the job title; you can click the job to open it.

**Recommended order for new users:** Complete your CV sections → add job applications → open a job → use "Generate AI CV for this job" or "Tailor CV for this job…" to create your first variant. The dashboard shows a "Getting started" hint when you have no jobs or no variants.

- **Excel spreadsheets** (.xls, .xlsx)
- **Text files** (.txt, .csv)
- **Images** (.jpg, .jpeg, .png) - with optional OCR support

### How File Uploads Work with AI

1. **Upload Files**
   - When creating or editing a job application, use the file upload section
   - Drag and drop files or click to browse
   - Multiple files can be uploaded per application
   - Maximum file size: 10MB per file

2. **AI Integration**
   - When you click "Generate AI CV", the system automatically:
     - Checks for uploaded files
     - Extracts text from files (PDF, Word, Excel, text)
     - Combines file content with any text in the job description field
     - Uses the combined content to generate your CV variant

3. **Text Extraction**
   - Click "Extract Text" on any uploaded file to populate the job description field
   - Useful for reviewing or editing the extracted content
   - Works with PDF, Word, Excel, and text files

### Benefits
- **No manual copying**: Upload the job posting file directly
- **Better accuracy**: AI reads the complete job description from files
- **Time saving**: Skip copy-paste steps
- **File organisation**: Keep all application materials in one place

## Best Practices

1. **Keep master CV updated**: AI rewriting uses your master CV as the base
2. **Include complete job descriptions**: More detail = better AI rewriting
3. **Review AI output**: Always check AI-generated content for accuracy
4. **Use quality assessments**: Regularly assess your CV to identify improvements
5. **Create variants strategically**: Generate variants for jobs that are good matches
6. **Edit after generation**: Fine-tune AI-generated content to match your voice

## Limitations

- AI rewriting maintains factual accuracy but may need manual refinement
- Quality assessments are AI-generated suggestions, not guarantees
- Processing time depends on AI service (local Ollama may be slower)
- Requires internet connection for cloud AI services
- Local Ollama requires sufficient system resources

## Troubleshooting

**AI rewriting fails:**
- Check AI service configuration in `.env`
- Verify API keys are correct (for cloud services)
- Ensure Ollama is running (for local service)
- Check job description is not empty

**Quality assessment fails:**
- Ensure CV has sufficient content
- Check AI service is accessible
- Verify database connection

**Variant not displaying:**
- Check variant exists in database
- Verify user has access to variant
- Ensure CV data is properly loaded

## Future Enhancements

Planned improvements:
- Preview changes before saving AI-generated variants
- Accept/reject individual section changes
- Batch generate variants for multiple jobs
- Compare variants side-by-side
- Export assessment reports
- Integration with job matching services
