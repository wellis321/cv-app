## 🎯 My Recommendations:

1. **Pricing:** Start with **$12/month** for unlimited (or $99/year). Test with early adopters. You can always adjust.

2. **Agency Pricing:** **$79/month per recruiter** or **$599/year**. Include 3-month free trial for agencies.

3. **Launch Strategy:**
   - Post the B2C version on LinkedIn (target job seekers)
   - Separately post the recruiter version in recruitment groups
   - Create a simple landing page explaining both use cases

4. **Validation Before Building Paywall:**
   - Get 100 free users first
   - Survey them: "Would you pay $12/month for unlimited?"
   - If 20%+ say yes, build the paywall

5. **Free Forever Tier:**
   - Keep basic CV builder free
   - Limit to 5 job applications/month
   - 2 AI generations/month
   - This drives top-of-funnel growth

Would you like me to:
1. Create landing page copy for the different tiers?
2. Draft pricing FAQ answers?
3. Write cold outreach templates for agencies?
